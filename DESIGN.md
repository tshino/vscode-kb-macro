# Design Decisions

## Recording keystrokes vs. recording commands

First of all, we don't have any VS Code API that allows us to capture command executions at this moment. But, we could imagine that we have an event API for that. Let's name it `onDidExecuteCommand`.

If we could capture all the command executions, is it possible to reproduce the scenario by simply executing all the captured commands by `vscode.commands.executeCommand` API?

No, probably.

A command may trigger another command. It happens by directly invoking `vscode.commands.executeCommand` in a command or in some way indirectly like making side-effects like document change. So we must distinguish them to execute only the commands that are triggered directly by the user.

On the other hand, capturing keystrokes could be a good solution for reproducing recorded scenarios since a keystroke is always made directly by the user. A keystroke does not trigger another keystroke.

However, we don't have any VS Code API to capture keystrokes directly.

## Capturing keystrokes

We have keybindings. Using that feature we can associate keystrokes with commands.

However, we can't associate every possible keystroke by defining a single keybinding rule (imagine kind of using wildcard `"key": "*"`).

So we end up defining a bunch of wrapper keybindings to capture the whole set of the default keybindings of VS Code.

## Wrapper keybindings

A wrapper keybinding associates a particular combination of `key` and `when` with the `kb-macro.wrap` command with `args` parameter that specifies the target command to be invoked. The `kb-macro.wrap` command executes the target command. This indirect execution makes it possible to capture the command that has been triggered by user's keystrokes.

We use the wrapper command only when the macro recording is ongoing. So we add the `kb-macro.recording` context to every wrapper keybinding.

Why don't we use the wrapper keybindings always to simplify things? Because we want to keep the original behavior of each command for the keybindings as much as possible. It is not clear but the indirect execution may not be perfectly transparent.

## Default wrapper keybindings

This extension defines a large set of keybindings to capture all the default keyboard shortcuts of VS Code.

The list of default wrapper keybindings is defined in the `package.json` of this extension. The list is automatically generated by a script `generator/gen_wrapper.js`. The script takes JSON files where each one contains the default keybindings of VS Code for Windows, Linux, and macOS respectively, and combines all the keybindings in them with additional context such as `isWindows`, `isLinux`, or `isMac` as needed, and convert them to wrappers and write them into `keybindings` section of the `package.json`.

The script also performs some optimization work to reduce the amount of wrapper keybinding rules.

| `generator/default-keybindings-linux.json` | the default keybindings of VS Code for Linux |
| `generator/default-keybindings-mac.json` | the default keybindings of VS Code for macOS |
| `generator/gen_wrapperjs` | a script to generate default wrapper keybindings and write them in `package.json` |
| `generator/verify_wrapperjs` | a script to verify the output of `gen_wrapper.js` |

## Capturing typed characters

On VS Code, typed characters in text editors are treated differently than other keystrokes. We don't put every possible character in the keybindings. When you type characters in a text editor, for each character, the `type` build-in command is invoked internally. The `type` command performs inserting each character into the document.

As far as I know, an extension is allowed to override the `type` built-in command using `vscode.commands.registerCommand` API. Actually, the VSCodeVim extension seems to do that to customize the behavior for typed characters.

It was not clear whether overriding the `type` command to capture typed characters is a good way for this extension. Especially if you use this extension combined with another extension that is overriding the `type` command too, there would be a conflict, and likely they will not work correctly.

So this extension took another way to capture typed characters. That is to listen to the events on changes on the text document. Basically this is possible through the `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` event.
